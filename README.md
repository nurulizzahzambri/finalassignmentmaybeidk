# Machine Learning: Phone Price Range Prediction

This is a **supervised machine learning** problem where the dataset includes X variables and a y variable

this app includes **5 classification methods**: K-nearest neighbours (K-NN), support vector machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.

User can analyse the quality of these models by looking at the generated **classification reports** using the recall, presision, f1, and accuracy score.
Then, user can also **predict the price range** of a mobile phone with certain values of predictors using any of the methods before.

The price range is 0 (low cost), 1 (medium cost), 2 (high cost), and 3 (very high cost).
